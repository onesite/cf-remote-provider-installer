  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nHelper cookbook that groups common functionality for all other\nCloudFoundry cookbooks.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nPlatform\n--------\n\n* Ubuntu\n\nTested on:\n\n* Ubuntu 10.04\n* Ubuntu 12.04\n\nCookbooks\n---------\n\n* apt\n* logrotate\n* rbenv\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nYou should never need to use any recipes in this cookbook on their own.\nInstead, you should include recipes from the higher level CloudFoundry\ncookbooks such as `cloudfoundry-dea` and\n`cloudfoundry-cloud_controller`.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nUser and group\n--------------\n\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['user']` - User that will own and run CloudFoundry. Default is `cloudfoundry`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['group']` - Group of the user that will own and run CloudFoundry. Default is `cloudfoundry`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['uid']` - Uid of the user that will own and run CloudFoundry. Default is `1002`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['gid']` - Gid of the user that will own and run CloudFoundry. Default is `1002`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['home']` - Home of the user that will own and run CloudFoundry. Default is `\"/home/#{node['cloudfoundry']['user']}\"`.\n\nDirectories\n-----------\n\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['config_dir']` - Where to write config files for all CloudFoundry components. Default is `/etc/cloudfoundry`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['data_dir']` - Path to the directory used by components to store private data. Default is `/var/vcap/data`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['log_dir']` - Where to write log files for all CloudFoundry components. Default is `/var/log/cloudfoundry`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['pid_dir']` - Where to write pid files for all CloudFoundry components. Default is `/var/run/cloudfoundry`.\n\nRbenv\n-----\n\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['ruby_version']` - The exact version of ruby to use to\n  run components. Defaults to `1.9.3-p286`.\n\nNats\n----\n\nAll components in a CloudFoundry cluster need access to a Nats server.\n\nThe recommended way to configure the server is to use search:\n\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['roles']['nats_server']` - The role that will be used\n  to search for a Nats server node. Default is `cloudfoundry_nats_server`.\n\nIf for some reason you can't or won't use search, you need to specify connection information on each node\n(ideally, using a role):\n\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['nats_server']['host']` - Host of the Nats Server that all CloudFoundry components will use for messaging. Default is `localhost\"`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['nats_server']['port']` - Port of the Nats Server that all CloudFoundry components will use for messaging. Default is `4222\"`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['nats_server']['user']` - Host of the Nats Server that all CloudFoundry components will use for messaging. Default is `nats\"`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['nats_server']['password']` - Port of the Nats Server that all CloudFoundry components will use for messaging. Default is `nats\"`.\n\nMiscellaneous\n-------------\n\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['domain']` - Main external domain. Defaults to\n  `vcap.me`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['local_route']` - local_route is the IP address of a well known server on your network, it is used to choose the right ip address (think of hosts that have multiple nics and IP addresses assigned to them) of the host running the cloud controller. Default value of nil, should work in most cases. Default is `nil`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['capacity']['memory']` - Maximum amount of memory that an application can request. Default is `2048`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['capacity']['max_uris']` - Maximum number of uris to which an application can be bound. Default is `4`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['capacity']['max_services']` - Maximum number of services to which an application can be bound. Default is `16`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['capacity']['max_apps']` - Maximum number of applications that a user can have. Default is `20`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['service_token']` - The token to use to authenticate services to cloudfoundry. Default is `0xdeadbeef`.\n\nRoles\n-----\n\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['roles']['cloud_controller']` - The role that will be\n  used to search for a cloud_controller node. Defaults to\n  `cloudfoundry_cloud_controller`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['roles']['cloud_controller_database_master']` - The\n  role that will be used to search for a node running the PostgreSQL DB that the\n  `cloud_controller` will use. If the role is `nil`, or if no node is found with\n  this role, the `cloud_controller` will assume a local DB. Defaults to\n  `cloudfoundry_cloud_controller_database_master`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['roles']['dea']` - The role that will be used to\n  search for dea nodes.. Defaults to `cloudfoundry_dea`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['roles']['nats_server']` - The role that will be used\n  to search for a Nats server node. Defaults to `cloudfoundry_nats_server`.\n* `node['cloudfoundry']['roles']['vcap_redis']` - The role that will be used\n  to search for a redis_vcap node. Default is `cloudfoundry_redis_vcap`.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Andrea Campi (<andrea.campi@zephirworks.com>)\nAuthor:: Trotter Cashion (<cashion@gmail.com>)\n\nCopyright:: 2012-2013 ZephirWorks\nCopyright:: 2012 Trotter Cashion\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
